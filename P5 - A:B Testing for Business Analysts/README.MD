The Business Problem 

Round Roasters is an upscale coffee chain with
locations in the western United States of America. The past few years
have resulted in stagnant growth at the coffee chain, and a new
management team was put in place to reignite growth at their stores.

The first major growth initiative is to introduce gourmet sandwiches to
the menu, along with limited wine offerings. The new management team
believes that a television advertising campaign is crucial to drive
people into the stores with these new offerings.

However, the television campaign will require a significant boost in the
company’s marketing budget, with an unknown return on investment (ROI).
Additionally, there is concern that current customers will not buy into
the new menu offerings.

To minimize risk, the management team decides to test the changes in two
cities with new television advertising. Denver and Chicago cities were
chosen to participate in this test because the stores in these two
cities (or markets) perform similarly to all stores across the entire
chain of stores; performance in these two markets would be a good proxy
to predict how well the updated menu performs.

The test ran for a period of 12 weeks (2016-April-29 to 2016-July-21)
where five stores in each of the test markets offered the updated menu
along with television advertising. The fiscal week for Round Roasters is
from Friday through Thursday.

The comparative period is the test period, but for last year.

You’ve been asked to analyze the results of the experiment to determine
whether the menu changes should be applied to all stores. The predicted
impact to gross sales should be enough to justify the increased
marketing budget: at least 18% increase in gross sales growth compared
to the comparative period while compared to the control stores;
otherwise known as incremental lift.

You have been able to gather three data files to use for your analysis:

- Transaction data for all stores from 2015-January-21 to 2016-August-18 
- A listing of all Round Roasters stores 
- A listing of the 10 stores (5 in each market) that were used as test markets.
