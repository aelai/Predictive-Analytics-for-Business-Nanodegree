Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics Course

The Problem:

	The Business Problem You recently started working for a company
that manufactures and sells high-end home goods. Last year the
company sent out its first print catalog, and is preparing to send
out this year's catalog in the coming months. The company has 250 new
customers from their mailing list that they want to send the catalog
to.

	Your manager has been asked to determine how much profit the
company can expect from sending a catalog to these customers. You,
the business analyst, are assigned to help your manager run the
numbers. While fairly knowledgeable about data analysis, your manager
is not very familiar with predictive models.

	You’ve been asked to predict the expected profit from these 250
new customers. Management does not want to send the catalog out to
these new customers unless the expected profit contribution exceeds
$10,000.

	Details The costs of printing and distributing is $6.50 per
catalog. The average gross margin (price - cost) on all products sold
through the catalog is 50%. Make sure to multiply your revenue by the
gross margin first before you subtract out the $6.50 cost when
calculating your profit. Write a short report with your
recommendations outlining your reasons why the company should go with
your recommendations to your manager.
