The Business 

Problem You recently started working for a company as a
supply chain analyst that creates and sells video games. Many businesses
have to be on point when it comes to ordering supplies to meet the
demand of its customers. An overestimation of demand leads to bloated
inventory and high costs. Underestimating demand means many valued
customers won't get the products they want. Your manager has tasked you
to forecast monthly sales data in order to synchronize supply with
demand, aid in decision making that will help build a competitive
infrastructure and measure company performance. You, the supply chain
analyst, are assigned to help your manager run the numbers through a
time series forecasting model.

You’ve been asked to provide a forecast for the next 4 months of sales
and report your findings.
